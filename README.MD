# Wikipedia Web Scraper with Beautiful Soup

## Introduction

This project is a Python web scraping tool that uses the Beautiful Soup library to extract text content from Wikipedia pages. The main objective of this tool is to provide an easy and automated way to collect textual data from Wikipedia articles for various purposes, such as research, analysis, or content creation.

## Methodology

### Program Overview

The Wikipedia scraper is a Python script (`wikipedia_scraper.py`) that allows users to specify a Wikipedia URL as an input. The script retrieves the entire text content of the Wikipedia page and saves it to a text file.

### Inputs

The primary input for this program is the URL of the Wikipedia page you want to scrape. The URL is specified within the script.

### Outputs

The main output of the program is a text file named `scraped_wikipedia_text.txt` that contains the entire text content of the Wikipedia page. This file is saved in the same directory where the script is executed.

### Workflow

1. The program sends an HTTP GET request to the provided Wikipedia URL.
2. It checks if the request was successful (status code 200).
3. It parses the HTML content of the page using Beautiful Soup.
4. The script finds and extracts all paragraphs containing text.
5. It combines the text from these paragraphs into a single string.
6. The combined text is saved to a text file.

### Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

- `requests`: For sending HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing and navigating HTML content.

To install these libraries, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

## Results

The results of this Wikipedia scraper are significant in that they provide an automated and efficient means of extracting textual data from Wikipedia articles. The scraped text can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Research and analysis of specific topics.
- Content generation for articles, reports, or blog posts.
- Data collection for natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning projects.

By saving the scraped text to a file, users can easily access and analyze the content without the need for manual copying and pasting.

## Conclusions

This Wikipedia scraper project has provided a useful tool for web scraping Wikipedia pages and extracting text content. The key takeaways and conclusions from this project include:

- Web scraping can automate the process of collecting data from websites, making it more efficient.
- The Beautiful Soup library simplifies the process of parsing and extracting specific data from HTML pages.
- The scraped text can be used for various purposes, including research, content generation, and data analysis.

To improve this project, future enhancements could include:

- Adding support for scraping multiple Wikipedia pages sequentially.
- Incorporating error handling and user prompts for specifying URLs.
- Extending the program to scrape additional content, such as images, links, or metadata.

In summary, this Wikipedia scraper offers a valuable tool for anyone who needs to gather textual data from Wikipedia articles and can serve as a foundation for more advanced web scraping projects.
